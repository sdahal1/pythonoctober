# Basic - Print all integers from 23 to 300 then print "this is sparta!" after.

# for i in range(23,301,1):
#     print(i)

# print("this is sparta")    


# Multiples of 3 - Print all the multiples of 3 from 3 to 200

# for i in range(3, 201, 1):
#     if(i%3==0):
#         print(i)

#anotha way
# for i in range(3, 201, 3):
#     print(i)



# Counting, the Bootleg Way - Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 3, print "Free the three" instead. If divisible by 6, print "Running through the six".

# for i in range(1,101,1):
#     if(i%6==0):
#         print("Running through the 6")
#     elif(i%3==0):
#         print("Free the three")
#     else:
#         print(i)


# Whoa. That Sucker's Aiight - Add even integers from 0 to 100, and print the final sum.

# sum = 0
# for i in range(0,101,2):
#     sum += i
# print(sum)

# Countdown by tens` - Print positive numbers starting at 2021, counting down by ten.
# for i in range(2020,-1,-10):
#     print(i)

# Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)

# lowNum = 23
# highNum = 100
# mult = 4

# for i in range(lowNum,highNum,1):
#     if(i%mult==0):
#         print(i)
