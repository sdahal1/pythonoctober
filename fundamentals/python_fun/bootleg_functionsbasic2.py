# CountUP - Create a function that accepts a number as an input. Return a new list that counts up by 1, from 1 (as the 0th element) up to num (as the last element).
# Example: countup(5) should return [1,2,3,4,5]



# Print and Return - Create a function that will receive a list with three numbers. Print the second value and return the third.
# Example: print_and_return([1,2,3]) should print 2 and return 3



# Second times Length - Create a function that accepts a list and returns the product of the second value in the list times the list's length.



# Values less than third - Write a function that accepts a list and creates a new list containing only the values from the original list that are smaller than its 3rd value. Print how many values this is and then return the new list. If the list has less than 3 elements, have the function return False



# This Length, That Value - Write a function that accepts two integers as parameters: size and value. The function should create and return a list whose length is equal to the given size, and whose values are all the given value.
# Example: length_and_value(4,7) should return [7,7,7,7]
# Example: length_and_value(6,2) should return [2,2,2,2,2,2]
